# We have a script /root/free.sh on node00 that is used to check free system memory. We would like to create a cron Free Memory Check to execute this script at every 2 hour (i.e 12am, 2am, 4am etc), the command to execute the script is sh /root/free.sh and schedule should be 0 */2 * * *.


# You can create a playbook ~/playbooks/script_cron.yml for this.
